<a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-vegan-gluten-free-waffles/"><h3>7-ingredient waffles</h3></a>
<p>Creates 3-4 servings that stay in the fridge. I always add more almond milk into leftover batter before I cook on days 2-4. Recipe is gluten free but I use half AP and half GF flour.</p>

<p>I make 1/2 this recipe and that creates 6-9 servings. I sub at least half the butter with applesauce and reduce sugar to my liking.</p>

<a href="https://thetoastykitchen.com/cinnamon-applesauce-pancakes/"><h3>Applesauce Pancakes</h3></a>
<p>This makes about 6 pancakes. So I would 1.5x this recipe for two people to enjoy breakfast.</p>
